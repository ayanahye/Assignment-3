# My Personal Website

## Overview of the project
- This project is a personal portfolio that aims to illustrate my current skills, passions, projects, experiences, and the courses I am enrolled in. I adopted a more creative approach to the layout and background of the website by adding keyframes, transitions, and basic JavaScript functionality to allow animations. I also added a Contact Me section which includes a link to my email and my LinkedIn. The navbar contains links to the home page, projects page, and work/volunteer experiences page to ensure easy accessibility. 

## Link to the website
- https://ayanahye.github.io/Assignment-3/ 

## Technology Stack
- I utilized HTML, a little bit of Javascript, CSS, and Bulma which is a CSS framework. I chose to use Bulma because I heard it was based on Flexbox and was interested in learning more and observing how the components would be displayed together. Similarly, I often spend a lot of time making my websites mobile responsive, and with Bulma, most of this was done for me. 

## License
- After researching different licenses and their permissions, I chose to use the MIT license. As mentioned in the reference provided, the MIT license “allows users to do almost anything”. It is declared as a permissive and simple license to use.
